##General Info##
This Project is for a CSE 194: History and culture of Cybersecurity assignment. This assignment is an AR filter inspired by the film Hackers(1995)

This is written using MindAR, an opensource web augmented reality library. If you think it's cool, you can reference their documentation and make your own AR filter here: https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/

The web app should run normally in safari and chrome browsers, though you will have to allow camera access.
