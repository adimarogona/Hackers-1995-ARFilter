## General Info ##
This Project is for a CSE 194: History and culture of Cybersecurity assignment. This assignment is an AR filter inspired by the film Hackers(1995)

See yourself as a hacker using this filter! The filter has a cool "hacker" console window that acts as sunglasses and computer viruses as a crown. You can also type in your hacker name and add it to the filter! 

This is written using MindAR, an opensource web augmented reality library. If you think it's cool, you can reference their documentation and make your own AR filter here: https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/

The web app should run normally in safari and chrome browsers, though you will have to allow camera access.

## How this relates to Hackers(1995)
Hackers(1995) is a film whose storyline surrounds a group of young hackers fighting against being framed by a greedy corporate villain. The movie is definitely a time capsule of the 1990s, with its fashion, rollerblading, and its astonishingly beautiful visual effects. This movie showed hackers as everyday people and greatly influenced how people think of cybersecurity. I chose specifically to make an AR face filter because I believe a main cultural takeaway of the film was showing the normal relatable characters in the hacking field, and perhaps allowing people to see themselves in these characters. This represented a little bit of the hacker counterculture of the 1990s that people otherwise would not have seen. Even if it didn't directly inspire that many people into going into tech or hacking, it at least made a step in expanding the picture inside the public consciousness of what people in cybersecurity looked and acted like. For the 1990s, the cast of the film was quite diverse which I think helped people relate more to these hacker characters. However, I do have some thoughts on the diversity of the film when it comes to its representation of women. I noticed that there was only one woman hacker character and for 3/4 of the film she was treated as a romantic role for the main character and nothing more. If any women out there want to try this filter together and pretend the film passes the Bechdel test, go ahead. Regardless, it was an interesting film and I loved the visuals and underlying political themes amongst its goofy plot. I definitely plan to pull out my old rollerblades now after watching it.
